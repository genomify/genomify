  **Condition**

  Overweight people can lose weight with the help of a calorie-reduced diet, which usually lasts several weeks to months. In this process, fewer calories are eaten than consumed each day, so the body has to draw on its fat reserves. After successfully reaching the target weight, most people resume a normal diet, ending the reduced-calorie diet. This can lead to the well-known JoJo effect in a group of people. After some time, they fall back to their old weight or even beyond.


  **Recommendations**s

  •    To lose weight sustainably and maintain your desired weight in the long term, temporary diets are not suitable for you. Instead, you should fundamentally change your eating habits and observe the following points.

  •    Limit the amount of high-calorie foods, such as white bread or table sugar. These contain short-chain carbohydrates that fill you up only for a short time and encourage you to eat more often. High-fat foods, such as cheese or sausage, are also high in calories. Be sure to eat them only in moderation.
